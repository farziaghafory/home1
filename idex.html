            <h3 id="headline">Here is the overview of Mawlana Jalaleddin Rumi Balkhi life</h3>
            <p>Rumi was born to Persian parents in Balkh, modern-day Afghanistan or Wakhsh, a village on the East bank
                of the Wakhsh River known as Sangtuda in present-day Tajikistan. The area, culturally adjacent to Balkh,
                is where Mawlânâ's father, Bahâ' uddîn Walad, was a preacher and jurist.He lived and worked there until
                1212, when Rumi was aged around five and the family moved to Samarkand.[3]

                Greater Balkh was at that time a major centre of Persian culture and Sufism had developed there for
                several centuries. The most important influences upon Rumi, besides his father, were the Persian poets
                Attar and Sanai.Rumi expresses his appreciation: "Attar was the spirit, Sanai his eyes twain, And in
                time thereafter, Came we in their train" and mentions in another poem: "Attar has traversed the seven
                cities of Love, We are still at the turn of one street". His father was also connected to the spiritual
                lineage of Najm al-Din Kubra.[18]

                Rumi lived most of his life under the Persianate Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, where he produced his works
                and died in 1273 AD. He was buried in Konya, and his shrine became a place of pilgrimage. Upon his
                death, his followers and his son Sultan Walad founded the Mevlevi Order, also known as the Order of the
                Whirling Dervishes, famous for the Sufi dance known as the Sama ceremony. He was laid to rest beside his
                father, and over his remains a shrine was erected. A hagiographical account of him is described in Shams
                ud-Din Ahmad Aflāki's Manāqib ul-Ārifīn (written between 1318 and 1353). This biography needs to be
                treated with care as it contains both legends and facts about Rumi.For example, Professor Franklin Lewis
                of the University of Chicago, author of the most complete biography on Rumi, has separate sections for
                the hagiographical biography of Rumi and the actual biography about him.
